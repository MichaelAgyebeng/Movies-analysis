## Dataset

> The aim of this project is to run this dataset to produce meaningful and accurate inferences about movies released between 1960 and 2015. Each row contains information about a speific movie on which we would explore.This data set is taken from a [kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/code/deepak525/investigate-tmdb-movie-dataset).
There are 10,866 movies in the dataset with 21 features (id, imdb_id, popularity, budget, revenue, original_title, cast, homepage, director, tagline, keywords, overview,runtime, genres,production_companies,release_date, vote_count, vote_average,release_year, budget_adj , and revenue_adj). A few of the variables are numeric in nature, whiles some are strings and dates.
